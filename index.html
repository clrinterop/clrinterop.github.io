      <h2 class="text-purple">P/Invoke Interop Assistant</h2>
      <p>In marshalling there are many attributes and rules for dealing with types.
        Understanding all of these can be a bit daunting. To improve the development experience,
        the P/Invoke Interop Assistant was created. It is a tool that conveniently converts
        C/C++ to managed P/Invoke signatures or verse visa. It even comes with a database
        of Win32 functions, data types, and constants, so the common task of adding
        a Win32 P/Invoke to your C# or Visual Basic source file is made very easy.
        There is a great marshalling article on MSDN Magazine website which highlights the tool.
        We hope you enjoy it!</p>

      <h2 class="text-purple">Type Library Importer in Managed Code</h2>
      <p>Tlbimp is a command line tool which creates a managed, interop assembly from a COM type library.
        This is essentially the same tool that was released with versions of the .NET Framework SDK,
        but written entirely in managed code. Providing a managed version will enable developers
        to explore and extend its features. We also plan on adding new features to make it more
        customizable. Stay tuned for more enhancements!</p>

      <h2 class="text-purple">IL Stub Diagnostic Tool</h2>
      <p>IL stubs are dynamically generated on the fly by the CLR and handle the marshalling and
        invocation of the target method. The IL Stub Diagnostic tool was created to ease the interop
        debugging experience. It is a real-time monitor which shows the details of every IL stub generated
        by the CLR in a given process. For each stub, the tool currently displays its IL code as well
        as the signature of the managed/native methods. This release is supported on Windows Vista+.
        Further, we plan on releasing enhancements of the tool during the Visual Studio 2010 Beta
        period. Stay tuned!!</p>

      <h2 class="text-purple">CustomQueryInterface Sample - IDispatch and Aggregation</h2>
      <p>ICustomQueryInterface is a new interface that will be released in CLR v4. This feature will
        enable developers to provide their own managed implementation of custom and standard COM
        interfaces (except IUnknown). In this sample, we will show you how to construct a managed
      COM aggregation system in the context of a managed implementation of IDispatch with ICustomQueryInterface.</p>

    <div class="col-8">
      <h2 class="text-purple">CustomQueryInterface Sample - IMarshal on WCF</h2>
      <p>ICustomQueryInterface is a new interface that will be released in CLR v4 and we already released
        a sample above to demo managed aggregation and customized IDispatch. To further demo the power
        of CustomQueryInterface and the ability to use the .Net technology (WCF) within COM world,
        this sample targets the customization of IMarshal interface by using WCF.</p>
